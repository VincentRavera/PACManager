A naive dependencies solver to parallelize compilation.
This is a Work In Progress.

** Purpose
Parrallel pipeline compilation is not trivial to implement, especially for jenkins and it's weird groovy.

When compiling, we want to ask:
Given current pipeline status (done projects, and pending projects) what should start compiling next ?

This program should not:
- store data
- have an display
- contact any other resources to gain information about projects
- know your context before hand (pre-configuration)

This program:
- can accept a json
- can Move json data around
- is predicatable/functional (same input should always send the same output)
- can be non persistently configured per request to stay predictable
